# errpref v0.0.0
Light weight GoLang types for attaching error prefixes, function chain lists and error context strings to error messages.

This version of ***ErrPref*** was compiled and tested using Go 1.15.8.

Not much to see here folks. This is the first release of the ***errpref***
package. 

All tests are passing, and beginning tomorrow, I will be using the types
provided here in a real-world environment. 

Stay tuned ...
